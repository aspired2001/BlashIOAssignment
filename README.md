## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Add and arrange elements like input boxes, checkboxes, buttons, tables, and labels onto a canvas.

- **JSON-Based Layout Saving**: Save page layouts as JSON, allowing for easy reloading and rendering.
- **Publish Pages**: Publish the page layout for viewing on a dedicated URL.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Elements can be resized while being dragged and stay within the boundaries of the canvas.
- **Firebase Integration**: Save and load layouts using Firebase, providing persistent data storage.

## Future Possibilities

- **Custom Component Addition**: Enable users to define and add their own components to the layout.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Allow multiple users to collaborate and edit the same layout simultaneously.
- **Export to HTML/CSS**: Let users export their designed layouts as HTML/CSS code for use in external projects.
- **Advanced Layout Controls**: Introduce grid snapping, grid-based layout alignment, or a ruler to make alignment easier.
- **Authentication & Profiles**: Allow users to create profiles, save multiple layouts, and access them from any device.
- **Version Control**: Implement versioning so users can roll back changes to previous versions of their layouts.
- **Themes and Styling**: Add theme support to give users more styling options for their layouts.
